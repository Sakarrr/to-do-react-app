# To-Do App

This is a  To-Do application built with React and basic CSS. The app allows users to add and delete to-do lists, with data stored in the browser's local storage. It also includes a dummy login and logout functionality for demonstration purposes.

## Features

- **Add To-Do**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete To-Do**: Remove tasks that are completed or no longer needed.
- **Local Storage**: All to-do items are stored in local storage, so your data persists even if you refresh the page.
- **Dummy Login/Logout**: Basic simulation with login and logout functionality.
